# Fama-French Factors Analysis and Sharpe Style Analysis of Fund Returns  
---

## Summary
Factor analysis decompose observed returns into a set of explantory returns.  In this analysis, we will attempt to decompose the returns of a few selected funds using Fama French Factors.

The **Fama French 3-factor model** is an asset pricing model that expands on the capital asset pricing model by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factors.

The **Fama French 5-factor model** expands the 3-factor model by adding profitability risk and investment risk factors.

Alternatively, we will also explore **Sharpe Style Analysis** in which we will determine the fund's exposures to changes in the returns of major factors.
